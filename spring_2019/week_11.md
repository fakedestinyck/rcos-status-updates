This is the last statua update this semester (Yayh!)

## Last Week's Accomplishments

- This past week, I made this [pr](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/pull/435) to fix mistakes because of ruby's stupid design made by this [pr](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/pull/432). But it's not approved to merge yet.

## This Week's Plan

- This is not the first semester I'm working on YACS, but it is absolutely the greatest semester 
ever. I closed a lot of issue, and made a bunch of commits throught several pull requests. Links [here](https://github.com/yacs-rcos/yacs/commits?author=fakedestinyck).

## Anything Blocking?

- No

## Notes

- See you next semester:)
