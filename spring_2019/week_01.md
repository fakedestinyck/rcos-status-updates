## Last Week's Accomplishments

- This past week, I was able to fix a small problem on the footer of yacs. It was a wording issue. Pull requests [here](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/pull/404). Although it was not a big issue, I think it's a good start for this semester.

## This Week's Plan

- After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to work on [this issue](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/377), which fix the problem that when a user clicks on a course, if all sections are closed or conflicted with current schedule, it's just not selected without notify the user. This behavior is confusing and needs to be altered.

## Anything Blocking?

- Good for now.

## Notes

- The issue I am currently working is the milestone, so I should probably fix it in a week.
