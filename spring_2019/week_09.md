## Last Week's Accomplishments

- This past week, this [pr](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/pull/432) is merged. I also made another [pr](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/pull/435), but it needs some changes.

## This Week's Plan

- This week, since my last pr has some problems because of ruby's stupid design, I need to make another pull request to fix this. Then I will work on [issue #397](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/397) and [issue #398](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/398).

## Anything Blocking?

- Good for now.
