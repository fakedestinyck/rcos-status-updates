## Last Week's Accomplishments

- This past week, I worked on [this issue](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/398). This issue has four sub-issues.
I was looking at these [two](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/279) [issues](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/280).

## This Week's Plan

- This week, I'm still working issues above. I'll try to finish all four of them in one or two weeks. 

## Anything Blocking?

- The issue I am working on is the first issue that focuses on backend. I need to learn Ruby before working on that.
