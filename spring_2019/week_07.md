## Last Week's Accomplishments

- This past week, I finished these [two](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/279)
[issues](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/280).
I made a [pr](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/pull/432) and it is currently waiting for somebody's review.

## This Week's Plan

- This week, once the pr I mentioned above is merged, I'll make another pr for [#280](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/280).
I also need to talk to our group leader and discuss how to finish [issue #397](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/397).

## Anything Blocking?

- I'm not quite sure about how backend connects to frontend, so I need to work hard, look through other's code and find it out.

## Notes
