## Last Week's Accomplishments

- This past week, I was so busy that hardly do I have time to make much progress. I was still working on [this issue](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/377). I was trying to finalize the icon.

## This Week's Plan

- This week, I need to draw the icon and finish the issue above. I will then work on backend and start to deal with [this issue](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/398).

## Anything Blocking?

- I need *more* time!
- We need great UI designer!
