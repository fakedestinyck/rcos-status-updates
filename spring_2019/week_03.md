## Last Week's Accomplishments

- This past week, I was still working on [this issue](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/377). I finished the coding part, and made a few demos for the icon.

## This Week's Plan

- This week, I need to finish the issue above and resolve all issues related to list view. I might also start to do some work on backend. I will probably assign myself to [this issue](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/398).

## Anything Blocking?

- We need *beautiful* icons!

## Notes

- Probably needs more people work on UI and design icons.
