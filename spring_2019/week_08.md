## Last Week's Accomplishments

- This past week, I finished these [two](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/279)
[issues](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/280).
The [pr I made](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/pull/432) is merged.

## This Week's Plan

- This week, once my question on [this issue](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/280) is solved, I will make another pr.
I also need to talk to our group leader more and discuss how to finish [issue #397](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/397).

## Anything Blocking?

- Same as last week. I'm not quite sure about how backend connects to frontend, so I need to work hard, look through other's code and find it out.
