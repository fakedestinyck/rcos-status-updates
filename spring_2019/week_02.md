## Last Week's Accomplishments

- This past week, I was working on [this issue](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/377). I finished a mock up and somehow made some changes. However, it seems that I misunderstood the issue, and need to modify the entire code.

## This Week's Plan

- This week, I need to work on the same issue above, and make some corrections to finish [this pull request](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/pull/414),

## Anything Blocking?

- Good for now.

## Notes

- The reason I misunderstood the problem is because I didn't communicate well with our project leader. I think I need to confirm what I should do before designing and coding.
