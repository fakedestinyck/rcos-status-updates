## Last Week's Accomplishments

- This past week, I made another commit to this [pr](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/pull/435) to fix mistakes because of ruby's stupid design made by this [pr](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/pull/432). But it's not approved to merge yet.

## This Week's Plan

- This week, since my last pr includes [issue #397](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/397), I will try to wrap up everything and finish this [big issue](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/398).

## Anything Blocking?

- Good for now.
